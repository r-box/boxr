# boxr <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

A lightweight, *opinionated*, high-level R interface to the box.com API, standing on the shoulders of **[httr](https://github.com/r-lib/httr)**.

[Box](https://www.box.com) is a cloud content-management and file-sharing service. The goal of the **boxr** package is to make it easier for you to conduct data analyses that interact with your Box account.

## New in boxr 0.3.5

It has been a while since the last CRAN release of boxr; we are pleased to to announce:

  - the package-documentation has been fortified, including a [pkgdown site](`r url_site()`).

  - a new authentication method: `box_auth_service()`, described in this [article](`r url_site("articles/boxr-app-service.html")`).
  
  - new maintainers: the creator of boxr, Brendan Rocks, is now maintainer-emeritus. The day-to-day maintenance is handled by Nathan Day and Ian Lyttle.
  
Other changes are detailed in the [NEWS](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/news/index.html).

## Installation

You can download boxr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=boxr), with:

```R
install.packages("boxr")
```
 
If you'd like to download the development version from GitHub, use:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-box/boxr")
```

### Documentation

The package-documentation website is created and maintained using [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org). Upon the CRAN release for version 0.3.5, the documentation website consists of:

  - a [CRAN-version site](`r url_site()`).
  - a [development-version site](`r url_site("dev")`).

## Usage

We have a [Get-started article](`r url_site("articles/boxr.html")`) that goes into more detail on interacting with your Box account using R.

### Authentication

Any time you interact with the Box API, you will be using a Box application, i.e. a Box-app. If you've already used boxr to authenticate with Box, you've already used a Box app.

#### tl;dr

If you have access to `client_id` and `client_secret` for a Box-app, you can use `box_auth()` to authenticate:

```r
box_auth(client_id = "your_client_id", client_secret = "your_client_secret")
```

This will kick off a process that, all being well, will keep you authenticated for the rest of the R session. By saving this information to your `.Renviron` file, at your next R session you can use, without arguments:

```r
box_auth()
```

If you don't have access to `client_id` and `client_secret` for a Box-app, read on.

#### Details

You can think of a Box-app as the door through which boxr functions can access Box. For the most part, boxr functions keep this "out-of-mind". During authentication, Box-apps come to the fore. 

Getting the authentication to work the first time is most difficult part of using this package. Once you get it working, it should *just work*.

How you deal with Box-apps may depend on your situation:

  - **"I use a personal Box account"**:
  
    You will have to set up a Box-app, then authenticate to it.
  
  - **"I use a Box account that an institution manages"**:
  
    Your institution may have set up an app already; you may be able to authenticate to it. If not, maybe you can create a Box-app or ask your Box-admin team to create one.

The type of Box-app you use may also depend your situation:

  - **"I want to use boxr interactively, from my local computer"**:
  
    We recommend you use a Box interactive-app, then authenticate using `box_auth()`. You can read more in this [interactive-app article](`r url_site("articles/boxr-app-interactive.html")`).
    
  - **"I want to run an unattended scheduled process, e.g. a report, from a remote machine using boxr"**: 
  
    We recommend you use a Box service-app, then authenticate using `box_auth_service()`. You can read more in this [service-app article](`r url_site("articles/boxr-app-service.html")`).
    
  - **"I want to use boxr interactively using a remote machine, perhaps using RStudio Cloud or RStudio Server."**: 
  
    You could go either way; this situation is covered in both the [interactive-app article](`r url_site("articles/boxr-app-interactive.html#transfer")`) and the [service-app article](`r url_site("articles/boxr-app-service.html#transfer")`).
  
The differences between the two types of apps are discussed in this [overview article](`r url_site("articles/boxr-apps.html")`) on Box-apps.
 
### Basic operations

  - [Accessing Box directories](`r url_site("articles/boxr.html#accessing-box-directories-folders")`): `box_setwd()`, `box_getwd()`, `box_dir_create()`, `box_ls()`, `box_push()`, `box_fetch()`.
  - [Accessing Box files](`r url_site("articles/boxr.html#accessing-box-files")`): `box_ul()`, `box_dl()`, `box_previous_versions()`, `box_add_description()`.
  - [Searching Box](`r url_site("articles/boxr.html#searching-box")`): `box_search()`.

### Advanced operations

  - [Using Box trash](`r url_site("articles/boxr.html#using-box-trash")`): `box_delete_file()`, `box_delete_folder()`, `box_restore_file()`, `box_restore_folder()`.
  - [Interacting with your R session](`r url_site("articles/boxr.html#interacting-with-your-r-session")`): `box_read()`, `box_write()`, `box_source()`, `box_save()`, `box_load()`.

## Alternatives

Other ways to interact with a Box account include:

  - The [Box desktop apps](https://www.box.com/resources/downloads).
  - The *other* boxr, [written in Ruby](https://github.com/cburnette/boxr). Its motivations are rather different, and it covers 100% of the box.com API (e.g account administration, etc.).
  - Box themselves provide a [wide range of SDKs](https://github.com/box), including [one for Python](https://github.com/box/box-python-sdk).
