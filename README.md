A lightweight, *opinionated*, high-level R interface to the box.com API,
standing on the shoulders of **[httr](https://github.com/r-lib/httr)**.

[Box](https://www.box.com) is a cloud content-management and
file-sharing service. The goal of the **boxr** package is to make it
easier for you to integrate your Box account into your R workflow.

## New in boxr 0.3.7

### Bug fixes

- Harmonizes the default location for tokens; `~` resolves to the home
  directory for all platforms. A patch is applied offering to move
  tokens from “old” locations. This bug appeared on Windows only.

### Documentation

- Updates documentation, updating some steps and adding alt-text for
  figures.

### Build

- Reduces and rationalizes package-dependencies.

All changes are detailed in the
[NEWS](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/news/).

## Installation

You can install boxr from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=boxr), with:

``` r
install.packages("boxr")
```

If you’d like to install the development version from GitHub, use:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-box/boxr")
```

### Documentation

The package-documentation website is created and maintained using
[pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org). The documentation website consists
of:

- a [CRAN-version site](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/).
- a [development-version site](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/dev/).

## Usage

We have a [Get-started
article](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr.html) that goes into
more detail on interacting with your Box account using R.

### Authentication

If you have access to `client_id` and `client_secret` for a Box-app, you
can use `box_auth()` to authenticate:

``` r
box_auth(client_id = "your_client_id", client_secret = "your_client_secret")
```

This will kick off a process that, all being well, will keep you
authenticated for the rest of the R session. By saving this information
to your `.Renviron` file, at your next R session you can use, without
arguments:

``` r
box_auth()
```

If you don’t have access to `client_id` and `client_secret`, you should
read the [authentication
article](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr-apps.html) to
determine your next steps. In most cases, this next step will be to
create an [interactive
Box-app](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr-app-interactive.html)

### Basic operations

- [Accessing Box
  files](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr.html#files):
  `box_ul()`, `box_dl()`, `box_version_history()`.
- [Accessing Box
  directories](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr.html#directories):
  `box_setwd()`, `box_getwd()`, `box_dir_create()`, `box_ls()`,
  `box_search()`.
- [Directory-wide
  operations](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr.html#directory-wide-operations):
  `box_push()`, `box_fetch()`.

### Advanced operations

- [Interactng with Box
  files](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr.html#box-file-interaction):
  `box_collab_create()`, `box_comment_create()`,
  `box_add_description()`.
- [Using Box
  trash](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr.html#using-box-trash):
  `box_delete_file()`, `box_delete_folder()`, `box_restore_file()`,
  `box_restore_folder()`.
- [Interacting with your R
  session](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr.html#interacting-with-your-r-session):
  `box_read()`, `box_write()`, `box_read_rds()`, `box_save_rds()`,
  `box_save()`, `box_load()`, `box_browse()`.

## Alternatives

Other ways to interact with a Box account include:

- The [Box desktop apps](https://www.box.com/resources/downloads).
- The *other* boxr, [written in
  Ruby](https://github.com/cburnette/boxr). Its motivations are rather
  different, and it covers 100% of the box.com API (e.g account
  administration, etc.).
- Box themselves provide a [wide range of SDKs](https://github.com/box),
  including [one for Python](https://github.com/box/box-python-sdk).

## Contributing

Always very welcome! If you’d like to submit a pull request for a new
feature, ideally it would be documented, come with an addition to
[NEWS.md](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/news/), and have a test or two.
