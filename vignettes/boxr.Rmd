## Getting set up
To use boxr, you need to enable API access for your box.com account. The process is slightly annoying. You only need to do it once - it takes around 2 minutes.

#### 1. 'Create New App'
Go to [https://app.box.com/developers/console](https://app.box.com/developers/console), (when you are logged in) and click on the button 'Create New App', which will guide you through four screens to create your new app.

* On the first, select **Custom App** and click 'Next'.
* On the second, select **Standard OAuth 2.0 (User Authentication)** and click 'Next'
* On the third, choose a unique name for your app, this can be anything and click 'Next'
* The fourth screen should be a confirmation of successful creation, click 'View Your App'

#### 2. Set OAuth2 Parameters

'View Your App' will take you to the **Box Developers Console** and where you will be in the **Configuration** sub-menu by default. Scroll down to **OAuth 2.0 Redirect URI** and set it to `http://localhost` and be sure to click 'Save Changes'.

Keep this browser window open because you will need the client_id and client_secret for the next steps back in `R`.

#### 3. Connect boxr to your account
This means passing your client_id and client_secret to the `box_auth` function. These strings are not enough for someone to access your account maliciously. However, it's still a good idea to keep them safe, and out of any files or code which might be shared with others.

Run:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(boxr)
box_auth()
```

And paste/type the `client_id` and `client_secret` when prompted. If these are valid, a browser window should open, for you to formally grant yourself access to your files at box.com.


#### 4. And you're done
If `box_auth()` worked successfully, you won't need to do any of this again, and thanks to the magic of `httr` everything should *just work*. Your client_id and client_secret will be securely stored in your R environment variables, your hashed OAuth2.0 token will stored at `~/.boxr-oauth`, .gitignore'd if necessary, and automatically refreshed when needed. If you would like to automatically authenticate each time the package is loaded, consider running `box_auth_on_attach(TRUE)`.


## Usage
### Basic Operations
Aside from file upload/download, boxr provides functions which mirror base R operations for local files.

* `box_dl(file_id)` and `box_ul(file = 'path/to/file')` to download and upload files respectively
* `box_load()`/`box_save()` for remote R workspaces
* `box_read()` to read files straight into R (e.g. .csv or .xlsx files as `data.frames`)
* `box_setwd()`/`box_getwd()` to get/set a default box folder
* `box_source()` to read and execute remote code
* `box_write()` to write R objects the remotely hosted files
* `box_search()` to query files stored on box.com
* `box_add_description()` add text descriptions to your files on box.com


### Directory wide Operations
Cloud storage services can complement version control systems for code, which aren't well suited to large binary files (e.g. databases, .RData, or heaps of pdfs). box explicitly versions binary files, keeping old ones, and making it easy fall back to an older copy.

boxr provides *git style* facilities to upload, download, and synchronize the contents of entire local and remote directories. At the time of writing, the box.com API does not support this directly, and so boxr recursively loops through directory structures.

![Synch a whole directory!](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brendan-misc/boxr_console.png)

* `box_push` will update the remote directory with new/changed local files
* `box_fetch` will update the local directory with new/changed remote files

These functions all have `overwrite` and `delete` parameters, which are set to `FALSE` by default.

**Disclaimer:** box.com is no replacement for a VCS/remote-database, and familiar verbs are no guarantee of expected behavior! Do check the function documentation before jumping in.

### Piping
boxr's functions have been designed to be 'pipable'. Here's a little example:

```r
library(boxr)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)

# 'nycflights13.json' is the same as nycflights13::flights, if you want to
# follow along at home

box_auth()

box_search("nycflights13.json") %>%                # Find a remote file
  box_read() %>%                                   # Download it as a data.frame
    group_by(origin, dest, month) %>%              #   Do some, er, cutting edge
    summarise(mu = mean(arr_delay), n = n()) %>%   #   analysis with dplyr!
  box_write("delay_summary.xlsx") %>%              # Convert to .xlsx, upload
  box_add_description("Check out these averages!") # Add a description to your file!

```

### File/Folder IDs
Are how box.com identifies things. You can find them in an item's URL:

## Notes
#### Verbosity
boxr is by default rather verbose, printing status to the console with `cat`. This is 'rude' package behaviour, and may cause unwanted output if used in conjunction with the excellent [`knitr`](https://github.com/yihui/knitr) package.

To supress messages produced using `cat`, set boxr's verbose option with:

```{r}
options(boxr.verbose = FALSE)
```
#### Alternatives
boxr aims to expedite data analysis/communication/distribution. Other ways to manipulate a box.com account include:

* The box desktop app
* The *other* boxr, [written in Ruby](https://github.com/cburnette/boxr). It's motivations are rather different, and it covers 100% of the box.com API (e.g account administration, etc.)
* box themselves [provide a wide range of SDKs](https://github.com/box), including [one for Python](https://github.com/box/box-python-sdk)

#### Managing your client id & secret
If you don't like the idea of typing credentials into your console, you can put them straight into `~/.Renviron` yourself, prior to the R session:

```bash
BOX_CLIENT_ID="youridhere"
BOX_CLIENT_SECRET="yoursecrethere"

```

(Note the final blank line).

## Reporting Bugs
boxr is a realtively new package. If you find anything that looks like a bug while using it, please report it!

The best way to do this is via a GitHub issue, at:
