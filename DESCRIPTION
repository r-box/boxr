Description: An R interface for the remote file hosting service 'Box' (https://
    www.box.com/). In addition to uploading and downloading files, this package
    includes functions which mirror base R operations for local files, (e.g.
    box_load(), box_save(), box_read(), box_setwd(), etc.), as well as 'git' 
    style functions for entire directories (e.g. box_fetch(), box_push()).
