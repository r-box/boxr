# this is a bit of a hack - this code is at the start of *each* of the vignettes;
# I would prefer that it appear once

# We want to keep a *single* copy of the figures for the entire site. The 
# reference copy of the figures is in the package directory `man/figures`.
# The first thing we do in this vignette is to copy that directory 
# to an the `vignettes`

There are two steps you have to follow to get up-and-running with **boxr**:

1. Establish a Box application that will work with your Box account.
2. Authenticate your Box account using your application. 

Once you have completed these steps, `box_auth()` should *just work*.

To use **boxr**, you need to enable API access for your Box account. The process is slightly annoying. You only need to do it once - it takes around 2 minutes.

## Authorizing from a local computer

**1. 'Create New App'**

Go to [https://app.box.com/developers/console](https://app.box.com/developers/console), (when you are logged in) and click on the button 'Create New App', which will guide you through four screens to create your new app.

* On the first, select **Custom App** and click 'Next'.
* On the second, select **Standard OAuth 2.0 (User Authentication)** and click 'Next'
* On the third, choose a unique name for your app, this can be anything and click 'Next'
* The fourth screen should be a confirmation of successful creation, click 'View Your App'

**2. Set OAuth2 Parameters**

'View Your App' will take you to the **Box Developers Console** and where you will be in the **Configuration** sub-menu by default. Scroll down to **OAuth 2.0 Redirect URI** and set it to `http://localhost` and be sure to click 'Save Changes'.

Keep this browser window open because you will need the client_id and client_secret for the next steps back in `R`.

**3. Connect boxr to your account**
This means passing your client_id and client_secret to the `box_auth` function. These strings are not enough for someone to access your account maliciously. However, it's still a good idea to keep them safe, and out of any files or code which might be shared with others.

Run:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(boxr)
box_auth()
```

And paste/type the `client_id` and `client_secret` when prompted. If these are valid, a browser window should open, for you to formally grant yourself access to your files at box.com.


**4. And you're done**
If `box_auth()` worked successfully, you won't need to do any of this again, and thanks to the magic of `httr` everything should *just work*. Your client_id and client_secret will be securely stored in your R environment variables, your hashed OAuth2.0 token will stored at `~/.boxr-oauth`, .gitignore'd if necessary, and automatically refreshed when needed. If you would like to automatically authenticate each time the package is loaded, consider running `box_auth_on_attach(TRUE)`.

## Managing your client id & secret

To make you following authentications easier to, you may wish to put your client id and secret into your `.Renviron` file:

```bash
BOX_CLIENT_ID="youridhere"
BOX_CLIENT_SECRET="yoursecrethere"
 
```

Please make sure that your `.Renviron` file ends with a newline.
