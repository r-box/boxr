# boxr <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

A lightweight, *opinionated*, high-level R interface to the box.com API, standing on the shoulders of **[httr](https://github.com/r-lib/httr)**.

[Box](https://www.box.com) is a cloud content-management and file-sharing service. The goal of the **boxr** package is to make it easier for you to integrate your Box account into your R workflow.

## New in boxr 0.3.6

In this release, we add new some functions and supersede others in an effort to harmonize function-names. In fact, this will likely be a theme going forward. You can use new (or newly-named) functions:

  - to manage collaborations (sharing files and folders): `box_collab_create()`.
  
  - for file-operations: comments, and getting versions: `box_comment_create()`, `box_version_history()`.
  
  - to read and save RDS files stored at Box: `box_read_rds()`, `box_save_rds()`.
  
  - to browse to file or a folder: `box_browse()`.

Importantly, there is also a meta-improvement: all API calls automatically retry upon failure - thanks to [James Lamb](https://github.com/jameslamb) and the [Chicago R Community Collaborative](https://github.com/chircollab)!
  
Other changes are detailed in the [NEWS](`r url("news/")`).

## Installation

You can install boxr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=boxr), with:

```R
install.packages("boxr")
```
 
If you'd like to install the development version from GitHub, use:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-box/boxr")
```

### Documentation

The package-documentation website is created and maintained using [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org). The documentation website consists of:

  - a [CRAN-version site](`r url()`).
  - a [development-version site](`r url("dev/")`).

## Usage

We have a [Get-started article](`r url("articles/boxr.html")`) that goes into more detail on interacting with your Box account using R.

### Authentication


If you have access to `client_id` and `client_secret` for a Box-app, you can use `box_auth()` to authenticate:

```r
box_auth(client_id = "your_client_id", client_secret = "your_client_secret")
```

This will kick off a process that, all being well, will keep you authenticated for the rest of the R session. By saving this information to your `.Renviron` file, at your next R session you can use, without arguments:

```r
box_auth()
```

If you don't have access to `client_id` and `client_secret`, you should read the [authentication article](`r url("articles/boxr-apps.html")`) to determine your next steps. In most cases, this next step will be to create an [interactive Box-app](`r url("articles/boxr-app-interactive.html")`) 

### Basic operations

  - [Accessing Box files](`r url("articles/boxr.html#files")`): `box_ul()`, `box_dl()`, `box_version_history()`.
  - [Accessing Box directories](`r url("articles/boxr.html#directories")`): `box_setwd()`, `box_getwd()`, `box_dir_create()`, `box_ls()`, `box_search()`.
  - [Directory-wide operations](`r url("articles/boxr.html#directory-wide-operations")`): `box_push()`, `box_fetch()`.
  
### Advanced operations

  - [Interactng with Box files](`r url("articles/boxr.html#box-file-interaction")`):  `box_collab_create()`, `box_comment_create()`, `box_add_description()`.
  - [Using Box trash](`r url("articles/boxr.html#using-box-trash")`): `box_delete_file()`, `box_delete_folder()`, `box_restore_file()`, `box_restore_folder()`.
  - [Interacting with your R session](`r url("articles/boxr.html#interacting-with-your-r-session")`): `box_read()`, `box_write()`, `box_read_rds()`, `box_save_rds()`, `box_save()`, `box_load()`, `box_browse()`.

## Alternatives

Other ways to interact with a Box account include:

  - The [Box desktop apps](https://www.box.com/resources/downloads).
  - The *other* boxr, [written in Ruby](https://github.com/cburnette/boxr). Its motivations are rather different, and it covers 100% of the box.com API (e.g account administration, etc.).
  - Box themselves provide a [wide range of SDKs](https://github.com/box), including [one for Python](https://github.com/box/box-python-sdk).

## Contributing

Always very welcome! If you'd like to submit a pull request for a new feature, ideally it would be documented, come with an addition to [NEWS.md](`r url("news/")`), and have a test or two. This project has a standard [Code of Conduct](`r url("CONDUCT.html")`).
