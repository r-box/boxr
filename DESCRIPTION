Description: An R interface for the remote file hosting service 'Box'
    (<https://www.box.com/>). In addition to uploading and downloading files,
    this package includes functions which mirror base R operations for local
    files, (e.g. box_load(), box_save(), box_read(), box_setwd(), etc.), as well
    as 'git' style functions for entire directories (e.g. box_fetch(),
    box_push()).
