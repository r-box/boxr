#' Compare the contents of Remote and Local Directories
#' 
#' `box_dir_diff` is the internal function used by 
#' [box_fetch()] and [box_push()] to determine how to
#' which files and folders should be uploaded/downloaded, updated,
#' or deleted, to synchronize remote and local directories.
#' 
#'     
#' `box_dir_diff` works by comparing files in the **'origin'** to 
#' those in the **'destination'**.
#'   
#' For downloading files (e.g. with [box_fetch()]), the origin is 
#' the remote folder on box.com specified with `dir_id`, and the 
#' destination would be the local directory specified by `local_dir`. 
#'   
#' The reverse is true for uploads (e.g. via [box_fetch()]).
#'   
#' `box_dir_diff` decides what should happen to a file based on three
#'   
#' \describe{
#'  \item{**Presence**}{
#'  Is the file present in both the origin and destination? The filename
#'  (within the directory structure) is used to determine this.
#'  }
#'  \item{**Content**}{
#'  If a file is present in both the origin and the destination, does it
#'  have the same content? The definition comes from the file's `sha1`
#'  hash, which for local files is determined using the
#'  [digest::digest()] function from the package of the same name. For
#'  remote files, it is queried from the box.com API.
#'  }
#'  \item{**Modification Date**}{
#'  If a file is present in both the origin and destination, and the
#'  content is different in each, boxr will prefer the file which was most
#'  recently modified.
#'  
#'  For local files, the 'content modified time' is used; the `mtime`
#'  variable returned by [file.info()].
#'  
#'  For remote files, the `modified_at` date returned by the box.com API.
#'  This is the time that the file was modified on the box.com servers, as
#'  opposed to the time that the content itself was modified.
#'  }
#' }
#'   
#' **Why not use the content modified time for both?** 
#'      
#' With regards to the box.com API, `modified_at` is preferred to 
#' `content_modified_at`, as it includes changes to the file outside of
#' just it's content. This means that, for example, a collaborator could
#' roll back to a previous version of a file, or upload a preferred but 
#' older version. These actions count as modifications on the box.com 
#' servers, but not to the content of the file itself (they are reflected
#' in `modified_at`, but not `content_modified_at`).
#'     
#' Implementing similar functionality for local files is not possible in a 
#' platform-independent manner; content modified time is the only file-based
#' timestamp which has a consistent definition for UNIX and Windows
#' systems.
#' 
#' @param dir_id The id of the box.com folder which you'd like to use for the
#'   comparison
#' @param local_dir The path of the local folder which you'd like to use for the
#'   comparison
#' @param load `logical`. Should the results be in the context of an upload
#'   or a download operation? Permitted values are `"up"` or `"down"`
#' @param folders `logical`. Should folders/directories be included in the
#'   result?  
#'    
#' @return An object of class `boxr_dir_comparison`, describing the 
#'   differences between the files.
#'   
#'   It is a named list, it's entries containing data frames, 
#'   describing the files in each of the following categories:
#'   
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{**`new`**}{
#'       Files which are present in the origin, but not the destination. These 
#'       will be downloaded by [box_fetch()]/uploaded by 
#'       [box_push()].
#'     }
#'     \item{**`superfluous`**}{
#'       These are files which are present in the destination, but not the 
#'       origin. If `delete` is set to `TRUE` in 
#'       [box_fetch()]/[box_push()], they will be deleted.
#'     }
#'     \item{**`to_update`**}{
#'       Files which are present in both the origin and the destination, but
#'       which have more recently modified copies in the origin. If downloading
#'       with [box_fetch()], and `overwrite` set to `TRUE`,
#'       new files will overwrite existing local copies. If uploading with 
#'       [box_push()] (and `overwrite` set to `TRUE`), the 
#'       new version will be uploaded to box.com, with a new version number, and
#'       the old version still being available.
#'     }
#'     \item{**`up_to_date`**}{
#'       Files present in both origin and destination, with the same content.
#'       Note: A file may be modified at later date, but if it has identical 
#'       contents according to it's `sha1` hash, it will be considered
#'       up-to-date. [box_fetch()]/[box_push()] do nothing for these 
#'       files.
#'     }
#'     \item{**`behind`**}{
#'       Files which are present in both origin and destination, but where the
#'       content differs, and the version in the destination has been more
#'       recently updated. [box_fetch()]/[box_push()] do nothing for these 
#'       files.
#'     }
#'     \item{**`new_folders`**}{
#'       Analogous to the file operation, but for directories/folders.
#'     }
#'     \item{**`superfluous_folders`**}{
#'       Analogous to the file operation, but for directories/folders.
